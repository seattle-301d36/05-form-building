# Form Building

**Author**: Andy
**Version**: 1.5.0

## Overview
<!--
Using the knowledge we learned from the 4th lab we added a form on a new html page that will preview articles that can be copy and pasted to blogArticles to create a new blog article -->

## Getting Started
<!-- Get the handlebars CDN, utilize the proper script tag to instantiate handlebars templating -->

## Architecture
<!-- This was created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and handlebars. We also used the icomoon library for our icon menu. -->
